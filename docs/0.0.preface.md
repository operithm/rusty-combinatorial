# Preface

This repository is the result of an intentional reconstruction process rather
than a translation or optimization effort.

## 1. Reconstruction, Not Translation

The original FORTRAN programs in the source text were not ported line-by-line.

Instead:
- Each algorithm was re-derived from its mathematical definition
- Invariants were identified explicitly
- Control flow was rebuilt around those invariants

This mirrors the approach used in CLRS rather than historical codebases.

---

## 2. Abstract Algorithm Models

Every algorithm follows a consistent pattern:

1. Problem definition
2. State representation
3. Transition rules
4. Termination conditions
5. Complexity analysis

Only after this model is clear is Rust code written.

---

## 3. Rust as a Learning Constraint

Rust was chosen intentionally because it enforces:
- explicit ownership
- controlled mutation
- exhaustiveness
- correct handling of partial states (`Option`, `Result`)

Many algorithmic bugs were revealed *by the type system* before tests were run.

---

## 4. Tests as Proof Obligations

Each module includes:
- local unit tests
- boundary cases
- round-trip tests (rank → unrank → rank)
- known combinatorial identities

Failing tests were treated as design failures, not implementation failures.

---

## 5. Visualization as Validation

For combinatorial objects:
- order matters
- adjacency matters
- minimal change properties matter

SVG, CLI, and ASCII renderers are included not for presentation, but to **verify**
structural properties visually.

---

## 6. Applied Validation via LeetCode

Hard LeetCode problems were selected *after* algorithms were implemented.

This avoids reverse-engineering solutions and instead tests:
- adaptability
- abstraction quality
- correctness under constraint

---

## 7. Lessons Learned

- Most algorithmic errors are **state modeling errors**
- Correctness emerges from invariants, not clever loops
- Rust rewards explicit thinking
- Tests reveal conceptual gaps faster than documentation
- Persistence matters more than speed

---

## Closing Note

This repository is a learning artifact.

If you are reading it, you are invited not to copy —  
but to **re-derive**, **question**, and **improve**.

That is the spirit in which it was written.
